## Project Description

This project consists of 10 tasks that progressively introduce TypeScript concepts:
1. Basic interfaces and DOM manipulation
2. Advanced interface features
3. Function types and classes
4. Advanced types and type predicates
5. String literal types
6. Ambient namespaces and declaration merging
7. Namespaces and declaration merging
8. Brand convention and nominal typing

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Use basic TypeScript types effectively
- Design and implement interfaces, classes, and functions
- Manipulate the DOM with TypeScript
- Work with generic types and namespaces
- Merge declarations and use ambient namespaces
- Implement basic nominal typing patterns

## Requirements
- TypeScript 4.9.5+
- Node.js
- npm/yarn
- Allowed editors: VS Code, vim, emacs
- Files must end with a newline
